# Concrete: the path towards net-zero

A technical complement to my article _[There's no plan B for concrete](https://erwinkn.github.io/posts/cement/)_, on the role of cement and concrete in the climate fight and the perspective of the industry in a net-zero CO2 future.

It takes the form of an **explorable explanation** built into a **scroller article**, where text and visualisations live side by side.

This is still very much WIP and was written very hastily using D3.js, please do not consider this to be good code nor a complete article. Further work is needed before a polished version lands on my blog.
